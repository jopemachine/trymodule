A simple cli tool for trying out different nodejs modules.

![trymodule demo](preview.gif)

## Why?

I'm not sure the original repository is being maintained, so I published this module by myself.

- Works well with Node 16 (LTS) and higher versions.

- Support ES Module.

- Support PromiseLike type.

- Built with ESM and typescript.

## Installation

`npm install -g @jopemachine/trymodule`

## Usage

`trymodule colors`

Downloads the module colors if needed, and starts a nodejs REPL with colors loaded in the current scope, ready for you to use.

`trymodule colors lodash`

Same as above but with many packages in one go!

`trymodule colors=c lodash=l`

Assign packages to custom variable names.

`trymodule --clear`

Removes the directory where trymodules stores the node modules. Removes `TRYMODULE_PATH + '/node_modules'`

## Configuration

There are a couple of environment variables you can use to customize trymodule.

`TRYMODULE_PATH` for setting the path of where modules are stored. By default this is `$HOME/.trymodule` or `$USERPROFILE/.trymodule`

`TRYMODULE_NONINTERACTIVE` for making trymodule not fire up the repl in the end. This is useful if you want to just install some packages for future use. By default this is undefined. Setting it to any value would make trymodule non-interactive.

`TRYMODULE_HISTORY_PATH` for changing where to save the repl history. Should be pointing to a user write-able file. Defaults to `$TRYMODULE_PATH/repl_history`

You can set the environment variables for one session with `export TRYMODULE_PATH=/usr/bin/trymodule` or for just one time by doing `TRYMOUDLE_PATH=/usr/bin/trymodule trymodule colors`.

## Inspiration

Inspiration comes from a leiningen plugin called [lein-try](https://github.com/rkneufeld/lein-try) that allows you to try out clojure libraries without having to declare them in an existing project. Thanks to [@rkneufeld](https://github.com/rkneufeld) for the inspiration!
